  - Debug code
    - Diagramming
    - Draw tile chunks so we can verify that things are aligned / in the chunks we want them to be in / etc.

  - Entity System
    - What to do about geographically disparate entities that might only partially
      get streamed in to a sim region, but which need to move together as a unit?

  - Audio
    - FIX CLICKING BUG AT END OF SAMPLES!!!

  - Rendering
    - What's the deal with 18,000 DrawRectangle calls???
    - Real projections with solid concept of project/unproject
    - Straighten out all coordinate systems!
      - Screen
      - World
      - Texture
    - Particle systems
    - Lighting
    - Final Optimization
    - Hardware Rendering
      - Shaders?
      - Render-to-texture?

  ARCHITECTURE EXPLORATION
  - Z!
    - Need to make a solid concept of ground levels so the camera can
      be freely placed in Z and have mulitple ground levels in one
      sim region
    - Concept of ground in the collision loop so it can handle
      collisions coming onto _and off of_ stairwells, for example.
    - Make sure flying things can go over low walls
    - How is this rendered?
      "Frinstances"!
      ZFudge!!!!
  - Collision detection?
    - Clean up predicate proliferation!  Can we make a nice clean
      set of flags/rules so that it's easy to understand how
      things work in terms of special handling?  This may involve
      making the iteration handle everything instead of handling
      overlap outside and so on.
    - Transient collision rules!  Clear based on flag.
      - Allow non-transient rules to override transient ones.
      - Entry/exit?
    - What's the plan for robustness / shape definition?
    - (Implement reprojection to handle interpenetration)
    - "Things pushing other things"
  - Animation
    - Skeletal animation
  - Implement multiple sim regions per frame
    - Per-entity clocking
    - Sim region merging?  For multiple players?
    - Simple zoomed-out view for testing?
  - AI
    - Pathfinding
    - AI "storage"

  PRODUCTION
  -> GAME
    - Rudimentary world gen (no quality, just "what sorts of things" we do)
      - Placement of background things
      - Connectivity?
      - Non-overlapping?
      - Map display
        - Magnets - how they work???
  - Metagame / save game?
    - How do you enter "save slot"?
    - Persistent unlocks/etc.
    - Do we allow saved games?  Probably yes, just only for "pausing",
    * Continuous save for crash recovery?
