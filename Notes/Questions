1.	day 13, analog input vs digial input

2.	understand while templates are bad, and lead to longer compile time

3.	day 112, cache line aliasing

4.	day 134
someone asked about "how do you procedurally generate character movement?" in the Q/A
Casey mentioned David Rosen_s GDC talk

5.	whats a dispatch table in C?
	how is it similar to virtual tables
            
6.	follow up on __stdcall on windows


7.	difference between macro and inline in practice

8.	day 187 we had bug resulting from the linker throwing away an function 
	and making it a macro fixed it. How does that work?

	

Things that I plan to bring to my game
1.  memory
2.  multi-threading, work queue
    add volatile for the variables

3. 	adding asserts everywhere
4. 	look at physics
5. 	look at the enforcing framerate
6.	write an asset system
7.	use STB font.
8.	write in "c with classes" stype
9.	debug profile system that you can compile out
10.
