math.h is the C runtime library include file, it ships with any version of C

any intel chips nowadays will have sse2

Streaming SIMD Extensions 2

x64 instruction set is just the 64 bit version of the old x86 instruction set. it was made by AMD, so it is sometimes referred as the AMD64



not every processor has the same set of x64 instructions. as the processor get revised over time, they add more instructions.
so they have sse, sse2, sse4, avx. some even add more registers that you can access

SSE2 has been around a long long time.

finally starting to talk about the coordinate system

screenspace has a backwards coordiante system

1. pixels vs world units
2. upside down y coordinate

proposing solution



1:05:22
dont like the approach of generate the world by seed on the spot





1:07:43 
compile with /fp:fast

this will make it not have floating point consistencies



1:11:20
why the return value is on a separate line?

for debugging
