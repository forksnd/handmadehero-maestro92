he defined float and double becuz he wants to define the size of his variable

float and double obviously corresponds to the two types in c and c++

float is 32 bit wide
double is 64 bit wide 

but of course there is the IEEE standard who defines it

64 bit double math is almost always slower. 

u can do 64 bit math as fast as 32 bit float usually becuz of SIMD

usually best not to go double unless you really have a reason to
