he defined float and double becuz he wants to define the size of his variable

float and double obviously corresponds to the two types in c and c++

float is 32 bit wide
double is 64 bit wide 

but of course there is the IEEE standard who defines it

64 bit double math is almost always slower. 

u can do 64 bit math as fast as 32 bit float usually becuz of SIMD

usually best not to go double unless you really have a reason to

Question: how does x <<= 1 actually work?
this is done in "Go To Disassembly" in visual studio

					x <<= 1;
				009E2BD6  mov         eax,dword ptr [x]  
				009E2BD9  shl         eax,1  
				009E2BDB  mov         dword ptr [x],eax  

stuff does not get operated on in memory, they get operated on in a register

look at what does x <<= 1 actually do 

- load from memory to register
- shift register
- write from register to memory
