mostly he's refactoring the code to work with 



                struct world_position
                {
                    /* TODO(casey):

                       Take the tile map x and y
                       and the tile x and y

                       and pack them into single 32-bit values for x and y
                       where there is some low bits for the tile index
                       and the high bits are the tile "page"

                       (NOTE we can eliminate the need for floor!)
                    */
                    uint32 AbsTileX;
                    uint32 AbsTileY;

                    // TODO(casey): Should these be from the center of a tile?
                    // TODO(casey): Rename to offset X and Y
                    real32 TileRelX;
                    real32 TileRelY;
                };


where in AbsTileX
the first 24 bit is tileMap Index
the last 8 bit is tile Index


nothing else interesting
