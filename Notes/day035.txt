if you just want random numbers and you do not want to use the C library and you dont want to write one yourself

just go online, have the internet generate some, and put it in a random number array. Pretty smart.

we only start to allocate space for the tile when we need to store tiles there

30:52
tile chunks will be allocated just in time

typically the compilers will do De Morgan's Laws for you

Voxel octree. Mainly used if you want to look at all three dimensions the same way

(just like quad tree, voxel octree is just a 3d quadtree)




1:14:20
is there a reason why chunk size needs to be a power of 2?


if it is not, this function won't function properly

                handmade_tile.cpp

                inline tile_chunk_position
                GetChunkPositionFor(tile_map *TileMap, uint32 AbsTileX, uint32 AbsTileY, uint32 AbsTileZ)
                {
                    tile_chunk_position Result;

                    Result.TileChunkX = AbsTileX >> TileMap->ChunkShift;
                    Result.TileChunkY = AbsTileY >> TileMap->ChunkShift;
                    Result.TileChunkZ = AbsTileZ;
                    Result.RelTileX = AbsTileX & TileMap->ChunkMask;
                    Result.RelTileY = AbsTileY & TileMap->ChunkMask;

                    return(Result);
                }

this is just a divide and remainder operation


he does explain using a graph at 1:15:20

global variables vs #define

obviously everytime you need to have parameters, it needs to be a # define
ir you are just defining a number, such as PI32, then it could be either obviously

when you pound define, you don't specify the type, so it could be used anywhere. not signed or unsigned

so it depends if you want to specify the type or not




1:21:10
why not have a door struct that points to to tile chunks?

Flexibility in displaying the world. For example if you zoom out to display the world. The door pointer scheme won't work
We always want to be able to query the world consistently, so we can see things


he brings up another example of a monster shooting a bullet through the wall.

it is very limiting to do it in the door pointer way

Another example is sound. It is very easy to propogate sound with our current way.

the actual bool time has semantics that I do not like. bools converting to true or false can have performance implications
