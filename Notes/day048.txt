Handmade Hero Day 048 - Line Segment Intersection Collisions

Finishing up the character sticking on the wall problem

so he did a trick where he clamps the t

				internal void
				TestWall(real32 WallX, real32 RelX, real32 RelY, real32 PlayerDeltaX, real32 PlayerDeltaY,
				         real32 *tMin, real32 MinY, real32 MaxY)
				{
				    real32 tEpsilon = 0.0001f;
				    if(PlayerDeltaX != 0.0f)
				    {
				        real32 tResult = (WallX - RelX) / PlayerDeltaX;
				        real32 Y = RelY + tResult*PlayerDeltaY;
				        if((tResult >= 0.0f) && (*tMin > tResult))
				        {
				            if((Y >= MinY) && (Y <= MaxY))
				            {
				                *tMin = Maximum(0.0f, tResult - tEpsilon);
				            }
				        }
				    }
				}

but apprently this is not how he wants it to be like in the final version

fixing a weird collision against the wall bug

turns out that is the result of the character glitching through the walls

addressing the issue with this current method, where we treat the walls as 4 infinitely thin layers
as oppose to a single AABB box
