Minkowsky Algebra -> Collision Detection
two typical uses of it: 
1. GJK
2. between two convex solids

apparently quake uses this technique

control theory: feedback systems, springs, "PDC"
				used in robotics a lot

				used a lot in controlling variables that we want to change over time. for example a missle changing its trajectory



Interval Arithmithic

				Arithimitic on ranges

				allows you to evaluate equations for ranges of values

torus vs sphere?
you once mentioned that a toro topology is if you start walking in one direction, you will end up the same place.
Doesn't a sphere also have this property?

How do we know if we are on a torus vs a sphere?

our space does not diminish in any direcion
the number of tiles does not diminish in any direction

whereas for a sphere, it will not be true.

As we go up in y, we will have to modify the number of tiles.

quaternions are non-euclidean

Rotations matrix vs quaternion

we assume that a Rotation matrix that is parameterized by an axis and an angle

so we are comparing the Rotation matrix representation vs Quaternion representation

the reason why you would prefer quaternions:

1: 	efficiency. rot matrix will have atleast 3x3, 9 values. and these 9 values have to be re-normalized continuously

	quaternion is 4 values


2:	there are a number operations that are trivial in quaternions, but more complicated to do in rotations matrix 
	
	for example, to actually construction a rotaiton matrix, you will have to take all the consine and sine


	quaternions, you only have to take the consine of the thing, and even that sometimes for consine, you just need to compute the dot product
	so a lot of times, you can construct a quaternions without doing any trigs


3:	quaternions has the nice property where it represents double rotations?

	u can do blend annimiations much easier in quaternions

	so easier to work on
