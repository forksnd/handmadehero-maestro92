a functional function is one that does not modify anything other than the parameters that it is passed in and the things that it returns

Example:
			int FunctionFunction(int X, int Y)
			{
				
			}

X and Y can't be pointers or handles, or anything that represents writeable memory



functional functiosn dont' change the state
