Handmade Hero Day 101 - The Inverse and the Transpose

Summary:
pretty much a lecture on linear algebra

hinted that he will explain the next episode why normals are tranfromed by (A ^ -1) ^ T,
Inverse Transform of the matrix, not A

Keyword:
linear algebra, normal matrix



5:08
if we do non-uniform scaling, where the x and y axis will not be scaled evenly
the normal is will not scaled up properly

6:59
shows a graphical representation of why scaling normal with the same scale matrix to the surface 
is incorrect. Essentially, the normals have to go through a different transformation


12:14
so apparently not all vectors are the same,

for vertices, we usually write them as column vectors 

				| px |
				|	 |
				| py |
				|	 |
				| pz |

but for normal vectors, we write them as row vectors 

				| nx ny nz |

so they are not treated equally in computer graphics transformations


15:02
introduced matrix transformations

and spent a bunch of time talking about linear algebra
