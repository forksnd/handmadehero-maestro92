his method is that the dpad gives acceleration to palyers
ddPlayer is acceleration

the reason why you can sometimes have problems with integraiton systems is becuz they can sometimes get out of control

he gives a graph explanation where the delta time can affect forward euler 

one solution is to use backward euler

really good for games.

backwards euler is where you go to the next timestep, and find the derivative that points back to the previous step
it will still be off the curve, but it will be off the curve in a less energetic place. 

but backwards euler is often more expensive, which is why u dont always do it
