in 3D games, you don't have to think really hard about what resolution you want to run in, cuz everything is always resampled
1920 x 1080 target resolution



1920 x 1080 x 60 hz (GPU)
so for a software renderer, we'll just do 8 times less

960 x 540 x 30 hz (software renderer)
1/8 of the work

if you just cast a float to an int, the default thing that C will do is that it will truncate the value.
so it will just get rid of the fractional part

for example if you are 0.75, rounding it will give you 0, but what you really want is 1. 
so we offset it with a 0.5.

about the the error that you see:

	LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'win32_handmade.exe'"

the debugger will have the exectuable locked, so we can't write to it
