I do not usually use bool, cuz bool is defined in c++ to have some kind of odd semantics
bool is defined to either be 0 or 1


when bool is compiled with optimizations on
Example:
					bool flag0 = (flag1 & (1<<30));

you might get "forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning)"

this is becuz in C++, the value of flag0 is either gonna be 0 or the value of flag1 with its 30 bit being set, so it is not gonna 
be 0 or 1

so C++ has to check if it is 0 or 1. if not he has to change from the 0 or (somevalue) to 0 or 1
