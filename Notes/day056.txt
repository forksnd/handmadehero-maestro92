Handmade Hero Day 056 - Switching from Tiles to Entities

Summary:
added entity indices in tile_chunk storages, 
this way we have spatial information of entities (which tile chunks contains which entities)

we renamed handmade_tile files to handmade_world

talks about the ways he can store the low entities, and the reasons of to do and not to do both things

1.  put the entities directly into the storage of the world. 
the problem of this method is that referencing specific entities becomes very difficult

                



2.  The world is just a spatial index into the low entity set
essentially the world stores the index of the entities 


We are making the assumption that we do not need references to entities most of the time.
most entities are not being referenced most of the time

the ability to refer to entities is a less heavyweight operation than the standard spatial processing of entity, which seems more common

final approach
tiles chunks stores indices of low entitiy arrays
