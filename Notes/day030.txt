floating point math is the fastest thing u can do

doing the same operation in the fixed point math requires a bunch of operation

typically the processors is as fast in integer as it is in floating point operations

why not just have an x and y position

the answer is becuz of floating point precision.  


either use doubles
or use an int and a float

Are there any consequences of hrader debugging if we use inlining

No, cuz almost every compiler that I'm aware of has a compile switch that turns of inlining
